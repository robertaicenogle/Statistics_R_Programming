# Fundamentals_R_Programming
An overview of the R Program.

## R Program Setup and Installation

### Install R
-  **Install R** before installing RStudio
-  To install R on macOS or Windows, navigate to https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html
-  Select a mirror link near your region (US)
-  On the download page, follow the appropriate download link (macOS or Windows)
-  On macOS environment, select the latest release .pkg file (the link is midpage)
-  On Windows environment, click on the base installer link. On the next page, click the "Download R for Windows" link to start downloading the installer
-  Run the downloaded file
-  Use all default install options and, if prompted, check all boxes to allow all R components to install.

### Install R Studio
- Navigate to https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/?utm_source=downloadrstudio&utm_medium=Site&utm_campaign=home-hero-cta#download
- Select the most appropriate installer link
- For macOS, drag the RStudio application into your application folder
- For Windows, run it through the installer as you would with any other Windows program

### R Studio Configuration
- R Studio has four panes within the application window
- Top-left pane contains your source, or any RScripts, tables, and files you open within RStudio
- Bottom-left pane contains the R console
  - Can interact with the environment in real time and test parts of our code before we write them in our scripts)
- Top-right pane contains our environment objects (such as variables, functions, and data frames)
  - Helps us keep track of the shape, data type, and contents of each variable without having to print out our variables in the console
  - Useful for tracking what each line of code does to our data
- Bottom right is the multi-tool pane
  - Contains tabs for a file explorer, R documentation help, installed package list, and a plot viewing tool
    - Plots tab for exploring our generated plots
    - Use the Files tab to open RScripts from your computer or to copy file paths to include within your RScripts
    - Finally, to learn more about a function or object from a library in R, simply type ?(<)name of function or object(>)

### Install Libraries/Packages
- Install required libraries to use them in our RScripts
  - Be sure to wrap the package name in quotation marks, otherwise R will throw an error
- To install packages in our R environment, use the install.packages() function
- Install **tidyverse** (https://www.tidyverse.org/), a robust library collection
  - Run the following in the R Studio console: > install.packages("tidyverse")
- Install the **jsonlite** library
  - Run the following in the R Studio console: > install.packages("jsonlite")

### Create a Working Directory Folder
- This will allow us to keep all of our RScripts and analysis results in a neat, organized structure
- Simplifies the process of reading in any external files into our R environment

**1.** Make a folder on your computer called "R_Analysis," or whatever would help identify your R analysis and scripts folder

**2.** In the R menu screen, go to Session, click Set Working Directory, then select Choose Directory

**3.** Navigate to the folder on your computer and select Open. If you click on the Files tab in your bottom-right multi-tool pane, notice that the folder now represents your active working directory.

**4.** Now create a new folder in your active directory using the "New Folder" button. Once you have created the folder, press the refresh ( ) button to refresh the directory to see your new folder.

**5.** Once you have created your new folder, use the file pane and click on the folder to navigate within it. Within the file pane, click on More and select the Set As Working Directory option to make the folder your new working directory.

*To set a folder as your default working directory, go to Tools, Global Options, General, and specify the location of the folder.

## Fundamentals of R Programming
The two fundamental components to programming in R are creating **data structures** and using **functions**. R uses named data structures to store values and properties, and uses functions to perform operations. The most straightforward R data structures are named **values** and **vectors**.

**Named values** are exactly what they sound likeâ€”they are a value that has been given a name. We can think of named values as a variable that has been given a single value. **Vectors** are R's version of arrays, where a list of numbers are assigned a location and stored as a single data structure.
